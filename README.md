## 📊 Data

* **Source:** Kaggle — [March Madness Data by Nishaan Amin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishaanamin/march-madness-data)
* **Files:** CSVs containing:

  * Regular season & tournament game results (scores, dates, seeds)
  * Team metrics (offensive/defensive efficiency, tempo, etc.)
* **Format:** Each row = one game, with numeric features and a binary label:

  * `win = 1` if Team A wins, else `0`.

---

## 🧩 Features

* **Seeds & Rankings** — Tournament seed numbers, AP/Coaches polls
* **Scoring** — Points scored & allowed per game
* **Advanced Metrics** — Efficiency ratings, tempo, turnover rates
* **Form** — Recent form (e.g., last 5 games) via optional sequential inputs
